	1  	JRE 1.6  	
	2 	resizable windows
	3 	send objects from metadata explorer to query builder
	4 	explicit commit-rollback mode
	5 	added table is not displayed
	6 	removed table from graph remains in SQL text

	29 	Support for natural join (workarround)
	30 	Oracle: performance problem when adding tables to graph (workarround)
	8 	storing joins informations in a csv flat file


  Exemple of using Join definition in a csv file:
	
    - customize FKdefinition.csv regarding your database 
      or use create_table.sql exemple.

    - Define your Join definition file (per datatabase) if needed.
      (now available for non-windows users)

    - modify "table owner" and "ref table owner" columns 
      with the schema name used (let thoses columns empty if none).

    - "table alias" has to be used when many FK are 
      referencing the same table PK
               
    - join type to be defined in INNER(defaul), LEFT, RIGHT, FULL

    - when connected to SQLeo
      set preferences (menu --> tools --> Query Builder)
        auto join ON
        auto alias OFF
        use schema name in syntax definition ON (when database has schema)

    - Open a query (menu --> file --> new query)
	add table FACT
	add other tables using the table click 
		"open all foreign tables" or
		"open all primary tables" or
		"references..."
	select columns, where conditions, group by, order by ...
        execute 
	query can be saved to .xlq, .sql or image
	data results can be sorted, filtered, exported to .txt or .csv
	see the specific feature "jump" that permits to open in a click
	a new window with "referenced data" (using joins and filters)

    - connection to the corresponding database needs to be restarted to 
      take FKdefinition.csv changes into account.
